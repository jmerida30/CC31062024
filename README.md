# Responsible AI: CC33106 - 2024
This course is designed for science and engineering students to delve deeper into the principles of responsible artificial intelligence (AI). It will cover the risks associated with AI technologies, strategies to create transparent and understandable AI systems, and methods to mitigate biases in models. Through theoretical and practical classes, students will use techniques such as PDP, SHAP, and LIME in various programming languages to achieve an applied and detailed understanding. Additionally, they will complete practical assignments that integrate the acquired knowledge.

## Repository Purpose
This repository is intended to work on our class resources, using a few Python snippets and tasks to understand the concepts of the course.

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment for Your Jupyter Notebook

### Step 1: Install Python 3.10

First, ensure you have Python 3.10 installed on your system. You can download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/).

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment using `venv`. Replace `venv` with your preferred environment name if needed.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
python -m venv venv
```
### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

#### Windows
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### MacOS | Linux
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
## Step 4: Install Required Libraries

The required libraries for this project are listed in the `requirements.txt` file provided in the repository. Use the following command to install the libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
